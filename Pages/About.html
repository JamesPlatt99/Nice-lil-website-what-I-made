                I like to play a few games here and there with friends, Counter Strike and Fortnite are always go to options.

                Can't go wrong having drinks with a few mates, generally drinking beer or whisk(e)y.

                Listing to music is a nice way to relax, generally listen to rock such as Queens of the Stonage, Kasabian and Muse.

                Walking my dogs is always nice, I've got two Cairn Terriers; Poppy and Midge.
